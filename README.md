# fxxk-ems-bot
A telegram bot for getting trails data of **apple** ems, using [telegraf](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf)

> Only for the apple ems mail now!!!

You can try it [here](http://t.me/fxxk_ems_bot)

But I think you will never use it

## usage

- clone this repo

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Thungghuan/fxxk-ems-bot.git

$ cd fxxk-ems-bot
```

- install dependencies

```shell
$ npm i
```

- set environment variable `BOT_TOKEN` and `BOT_HOST`

- start the server
```shell
$ npm start
```

## So why this bot?

Few days ago, I bought MacBook Air from Apple Store at its [back-to-school](https://www.apple.com.cn/cn-k12/shop/back-to-school) activity, but I still don't get it after 10 days.

And the trail message from ems updates very slow.

In order to get the message periodically, I wrote this bot.

> Actually, I just want to try to write a bot myself :)

> OK, I finally get my M1 MacBook Air on Jul 26th.
> This commit is updated by it.
